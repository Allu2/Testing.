    getInCircle(radius, center_location)
     This function will lookup information from the database for cases matching circle generated from center_location and radius.
     This process is done in two steps.
        1) We make a square that surrounds the generated circle. We use this to filter most locations that are outside out target.
        2) We compare the distance of each data point from the center, and if they are larger then the radius given, we ignore them.
     This should yield list of data inside the wanted area.
     Since this is for demonstration we ignore the fact world is not flat for now and use longitude and latitude as if coordinates on flat grid. This will probably not give accurate results.
